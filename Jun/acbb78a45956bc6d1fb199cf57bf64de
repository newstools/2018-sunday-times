The official music video for Rita Ora's track 'Girls' featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX. Rita Ora has released the revised music video for her single Girls featuring Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha. Girls was met with controversy upon its May 11 release, accused of doing more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community. The track was called out by queer music figures as perpetuating stereotypes: it was seen to miss the mark and perpetuate the male gaze. Ora initially released a statement defending the track saying she was inspired by Katy Perry's I Kissed a Girl. She also tweeted an apology explaining that the song was based on her own life experiences. Cardi B also tweeted her support, saying "we never had bad intentions with the song". pic.twitter.com/p53aQxfQg2 Listen to “GIRLS” by Rita Ora ft me @BebeRexha @charli_xcx .We never try to cause harm or had bad intentions with the song .I personally myself had experiences with other woman ,shiieeett with a lot of woman ! I though the song was a good song and i remember my experience . The new video, directed by Helmi, opens and concludes with an ensemble of women lounging on carpets and pillows. At one point, a holographic Ora and Cardi B share a brief kiss, which sent fans into a Twitter frenzy.
