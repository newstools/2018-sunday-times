Gold miners are benefiting from safe-haven trade, but the local bourse has opened with broad-based losses ahead of a week full of events threatening volatility The JSE began the week on a negative note on Monday, posting broad-based losses as investors scrutinised a spate of bad news. Chinese export data earlier showed an unexpected fall in November, while Japan's economic data for the third quarter was downbeat, with that economy contracting 0.6% during the period. Analysts had expected a 0.3% fall. Risk sentiment has also been under some strain after a US official warned that there would be no more extensions given to China after a 90-day trade truce expires in March. Markets are focused on the UK parliament on Tuesday, which could result in a no-deal Brexit. Chinese vice-premier Liu He is also set to visit Washington from Wednesday, which could prompt a renewed twitter offensive from US President Donald Trump, said Oanda analyst Stephen Innes. Locally, the week is data-heavy, with mining and manufacturing data due out on Tuesday and inflation data on Wednesday. Analysts expect local data to take a back seat.
