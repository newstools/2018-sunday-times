In the final episode of the Sunday Times Politics Weekly for 2018, journalists Qaanitah Hunter, Amil Umraw, and Zimasa Matiwane take a look back on the past political year. From the removal of President Jacob Zuma to putting the brakes on state capture and the launch of a surprisingly frank commission of inquiry. They dissect the starting blocks of Cyril Ramaphosa and challenges within the African National Congress. We get on the inside track of the Democratic Alliance and the coming Patricia de Lille challenge in the Western Cape.
