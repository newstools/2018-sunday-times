Encrusting items with diamonds is one sure way to increase their value and where shoes are concerned, designers have been known to give customers more than a little precious stone swag. Acclaimed shoe craftsman Jimmy Choo and designer Reggie Hung are showcasing a pricey pair of heels encrusted with pink diamonds at a trade fair in Shangai, reports Bloomberg. The shoes will set the buyer back a jaw-dropping $4.3-million. And this is not the first time this year that ordinary people were left drooling over shoes they couldn't afford. In September, the world's most expensive shoes went on display at the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, sporting a $17-million price tag. The luxury pumps are made of golden leather and boast 100 carats of diamonds. Hermani Karamchandani, CEO of Passion Jewellers which created the shoes, said selling the shoes in Dubai was a way to target the city's super-rich. "We can see some potential buyers here. Dubai is the city of millionaire and billionaires," said Karamchandani. The world's first gold and platinum-plated shoes went on sale for £217,800 in January. The high heels are handcrafted and encrusted with white diamonds and white sapphires.
