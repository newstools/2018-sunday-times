As in the Big Apple during New York Fashion Week, prints were everywhere in London this season - think animal prints, houndstooth, stripes and even arty images. However, checks stood out as the hottest trend. Checks of all sizes were seen on jackets, skirts, tops and pants at the Marta Jakubowski show, for example, and came in shades of pink or tiny sizes in Emilia Wickstead's collection. Nicopanda, on the other hand, matched checks with stripes and animal prints. The trend also brought tartan to the London runways.

Marta Jakubowski brought mini dresses, revealing necklines and bare shoulders to the runway, as did Charlotte Knowles with see-through creations. David Koma flashed shoulders and legs with mini dresses and skirts with slits.

The key is to build up as many layers as possible and to play with volumes and lengths - it's all about proportions. The layering trend was spotted at the Nicopanda, Burberry,Â Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and, to a lesser extent, Gareth Pugh shows.
