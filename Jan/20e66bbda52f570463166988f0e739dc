For her 12th birthday, my son's friend went skydiving and the video shows her euphoria. I felt the same way somersaulting out of a plane attached to an instructor: skydiving was an effortless rush. I jumped at Skydive Joburg near Carletonville from an aircraft specially designed for jumpers. This is not a run-of-the-mill kids' thrill but, for the brave child - or adult - it's a win. Contact Skydive Joburg: call 084-998-3178 or e-mail info@skydivejoburg.co.za Rates: Tandem skydive: R1,570. Paddling in double kayaks to see the penguins of Simon's Town in rough seas started well. My son loved the motion of the swell and the excitement. The penguins were their usual charming selves. But, if you're going with children, choose better conditions. Being drenched on the way back did not impress my young son. On a calm day, it must be idyllic. Or paddle to the seals below the Sentinel in Hout Bay.

On the outskirts of this old railway town is a green and shady campsite, known as Tranquilitas, which is a perfect place to start rock climbing (as I did, light years ago). Short hikes lead to some of the best sport climbing - safe bolted routes - in the country. Nine great mountain bike routes have been cut and mapped around Tranquilitas.

Magoebaskloof has crystal rivers and lakes in mountains that are often shrouded in mist. George's Valley has the most spectacular canopy tour I've done in South Africa. Zip lining over the waterfalls and rapids of the Groot Letaba River is mesmerising. The 11 slides are high so this tour is an adrenaline trip. Children can slide in tandem with a guide; the recommended minimum age is seven. Contact Magoebaskloof Canopy Tour: call 083-866-1546 or visit magoebaskloofcanopytour.co.za Rates: R650 pp including refreshments and lunch. The golden hills of Clarens offer great bike rides for families, particularly a 10km slick rock route overlooking the town and valley. For serious mountain bikers there are longer routes. Rafting on the nearby Ash River is the right antidote to the heat of summer and Clarens Xtreme has taken children as young as six on its boats. Their oldest rafter was 106. The cold river is fed by the Katze Dam in Lesotho, so the water level doesn't depend on rainfall. Contact Clarens Xtreme: call 082-563-6242 or 058-256-1260 or visit clarensxtreme.co.za Rates: Whitewater rafting R450 per person for half days; R650 for full day. Mountain-biking trails vary from R50 to R100 a trail. KWAZULU-NATAL: UNDERBERG, HORSE RIDING If you want a wild family getaway try Khotso Horse Trails. Our overnight horse trip included packing a passport - we crossed into Lesotho at Bushman's Nek border post. We followed an old donkey trail up and into the Sehlabathebe National Park. Our Basotho ponies were rock solid as they climbed narrow paths steeply into the mountains. We slept soundly in a cosy lodge built originally for King Jonathan.
