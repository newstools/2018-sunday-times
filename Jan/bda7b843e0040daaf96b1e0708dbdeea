Kanye West just pulled a Kanye West, and by some miracle got Paris Hilton to stow her (not insubstantial) ego and dress up like Kim Kardashian. Actually, that‚Äôs inaccurate: not like Kim Kardashian; as Kim Kardashian. The Hilton heiress donned a platinum-blonde wig and posed as a Kim-lookalike for West‚Äôs Yeezy Season 6 campaign, which also features model Amina Blue and (controversial) Instagram star Louise Delage in the same guise. There is something deeply ironic about Hilton‚Äôs transformation here, as it‚Äôs well-known that Kardashian was little more than Hilton's assistant-cum-acolyte before the former‚Äôs rise to fame. And, before their eventual reconciliation, Hilton never wasted an opportunity to reiterate this, claiming on several occasions to have ‚Äúcreated‚Äù Kardashian's celebrity persona. Whether she realises it or not, this is a symbolically humbling moment for Hilton, who seemed reluctant to accept Kardashian's burgeoning success when her own cultural currency was on the decline. That said, there is something charmingly tongue-in-cheek ‚Äìand surprisingly self-aware ‚Äì about her participation, as the relationship between these competitive moguls seems to have come full circle. Check out these snaps of the various Kardashian 'clones' in action: So much fun being a #KimClone in the new #YeezySeason6 campaign. üî• A post shared by  Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Jan 30, 2018 at 11:02pm PST #YEEZYSEASON6 A post shared by  I AM THE INFLUENCE (@amina.blue) on Jan 30, 2018 at 2:57pm PST #yeezyseason6 A post shared by  danger (@dangershewrote) on Jan 30, 2018 at 7:38pm PST #YEEZYSEASON6 A post shared by  Shannon and Shannade Clermont (@clermonttwins) on Jan 30, 2018 at 5:02pm PST
