We gathered a group of wine experts together and asked them to put curries from different supermarkets to the taste test. All the curries came in trays with rice. The curries were compared in a blind tasting where each curry was judged on aroma, appearance/presentation, taste, authenticity, ratio of protein to rice and whether the taster would purchase it. We asked the chefs of HTA Cooking Academy in Randburg, Joburg, to assist and under strict scrutiny they removed all the packaging, numbered the curries and heated them exactly according to the packaging instructions before serving them to the tasting panel Dish: Chicken Biryani Price: R59.99 for 350g What the judges said: Dish: Chicken Biryani Price: R62.99 for 350g What the judges said: Dish: Chicken Biryani Price: R44.99 for 350g What the judges said: Our wine experts tried a trio of tipples with their meals. Here's what they had to say: • Checkers: Odd Bins 111 Chenin Blanc 2017 (R34.99): “Fruity and too sweet. Not great with biryani.” • Pick n Pay: Ken Forrester Chenin Blanc 2017 (R121): “Wine great colour, great nose, good balance of tropical fruit.” • Woolworths: Pinot Grigio (R49.99): “Tolerate at best but still lacking in classicism.”
