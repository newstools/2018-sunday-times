What do Bonang and Beyonce's mom, Tina Knowles, have in common? They've both recently donned gowns by Lebanese designer Fouad Sarkis to high-profile events. Knowles wore one of the Istanbul-based fashion brand's dresses to the Kentucky Derby Gala, while Sarkis was Bonang's designer of choice for her hosting gig at the recent Miss SA 2018 pageant. The local celeb donned not one, but three Fouad Sarkis gowns during the show: a vibrant red off-the-shoulder number, a royal blue ballgown with statement shoulder detail, and an embroidered dress in a soft lilac-pink.

Today the brand sells what they call Pret-a-Porter (ready-to-wear) Haute Couture in several countries around the globe, as well as online at stores such as newyorkdress.com, where their dresses are priced from $900 (over R11,000). During the glamorous Miss SA 2018 finale, Bonang also wore two gowns from Australian designer Steven Khalil's latest Couture Collection, which showed at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. This includes a striking beaded, cold-shoulder dress and a black, high-necked embellished gown with a ruffle detail. Khalil's dressed the likes of Kylie Jenner and the Crown Princess of Greece, making this designer a fitting choice for SA's self-proclaimed royal, Queen B.
