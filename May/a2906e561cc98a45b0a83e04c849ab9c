Han Solo's hairy bestie, Chewbacca, may be a Wookie of few words, but he's got something important to say this Star Wars Day: "RAWRGWAWGGR!" In a humorous YouTube video, Ron Howard, director of the upcoming film, Solo: A Star Wars Story, helpfully translates his message: "Chewbacca is challenging you to roar for change. Just record and upload your very best Chewie roar. Post, like or share using the hashtag #RoarForChange to support a donation of up to $1-million towards UNICEF's lifesaving work for children." WATCH | Chewie's #RoarForChange challenge Star Wars: Force for Change, a charitable initiative by Lucasfilm and Disney, has pledged to donate $1 to UNICEF for every Wookie impersonation that's posted, liked or shared on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, along with the hashtag #RoarForChange, until they hit a total of $1-million. The challenge runs up until May 25, whenÂ Solo: A Star Wars Story opens in cinemas. This spin-off prequel delves into the backstory of Hans Solo and will reveal how he and his future Millennium Falcon co-pilot, Chewie, met. We'll also find out how old the loveable fuzzball is. Howard promises that the Wookie's part in the new movie will be "without a doubt [his] best role ever".
