Dancing isn't a classic catwalk move, but it certainly is a crowd pleaser. Nomzamo Mbatha thrilled show-goers at SA Fashion Week last night by breaking it down on the runway as she modeled an extravagant red ball gown. The gown was designed by celeb fave, Gert-Johan Coetzee, who collaborated with McDonald's to create a collection celebrating the Big Mac's 50th birthday. @nomzamo_m closing the show for @gertjohancoetzee at @safashionweek last night.

That said, the guest appearance by Mbatha certainly added spice to the evening. The actress later poked fun at herself for committing a minor fashion faux paus, posting on Instagram: "What not to do on the runway? DANCE ... But everyone joined in so I guess my moves ain’t that bad." @gertjohancoetzee collaborated with @mcdonalds_za to celebrate the Big Mac turning 50 - pop culture heaven! ❤️🍟🍔 @safashionweek 📸 Lizmarie Richardson Photography | Henny Marsh Photography . . . #SAFW #fashionweek #runway #igfashion #outfitoftheday #fashionphotography A post shared by  Magenta Magazine (@magenta_magazine) on Apr 12, 2018 at 11:49pm PDT
