Recently revived by Maria Grazia Chiuri for the Dior A/W 2017/18 fashion show, the beret is fast becoming this season's must-have headwear. As well as being brought back to the forefront of fashion by several designers, the beret has been widely spotted off the catwalkÂ â€” and not just on the heads of Economic Freedom Fighters. Indeed, it has been worn by everyone from celebs to the crowned heads of Europe. Bonang, Rihanna, Meghan Markle and Princess Charlene of Monaco are just some of the famous faces who have been snapped sporting berets. While the Frenchest of hats is now also the hippest, it'sÂ important to strike a balance when working a beret into your look, so as not to fall into the trap of clichÃ©s.
