The South African Film and Television Awards (SAFTAs) took place on Saturday, and the best local talent flocked to Sun City to vie for accolades â€“ professionally and sartorially. But while some stars successfully wooed us on the fashion front, others left us feeling disgruntled. Hereâ€™s our choice of the best and worst red carpet attire: A post shared by Nomzamo Mbatha ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ (@nomzamo_m) on Mar 24, 2018 at 1:24pm PDT This is the dress that everyoneâ€™s talking about. Designed by David Tlale, itâ€™s weird and it shouldnâ€™t work, but it does. The enormous sleeves somehow donâ€™t detract from the gownâ€™s subdued silhouette, while the black brush strokes on the skirt and bodice introduced an element of currency. Itâ€™s an outfit thatâ€™s likely to polarize opinions, but in ours, Nomzamo totally pulled it off.

Her unique take on a tuxedo was the perfect balance between elegance and originality. She looked cool, sophisticated and contemporary. A post shared by Thuso Mbedu OFFICIAL (@thuso.mbedu) on Mar 24, 2018 at 3:19pm PDT Not everything about the Emmy-nominated actor's look was perfect: her makeup leaves something to be desired and her bralette could have been better tailored. Still, we find the simplicity of her long, high-waisted skirt refreshing, and she made a memorable impression, standing out amidst all the heavy brocades and sequin-clogged satin on the red carpet. A post shared by Enhle Mbali Maphumulo (@enhlembali_) on Mar 24, 2018 at 3:44pm PDT The striking actressâ€™s Quiteria & George gown was a shock to the system. The ill-fitting, bedazzled bodice with sheer insets was further complicated by a skirt made up of metres and metres of what looks like ruched tulle culminating in a train.Â The end result was a sugar-pink cloud thatÂ somehow manages to be evocative of bothÂ small poodles and baked goods. A post shared by MapulaðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ (@mapulamafole_) on Mar 24, 2018 at 4:35pm PDT The Rhythm City celebutante wore a truly peculiar asymmetrical creation, which belied her maturity and made her look like she was stopping off on her way to a Matric dance. A post shared by Quinne Brown (@quinnebrown) on Mar 24, 2018 at 10:54am PDT The 7de Laan star wore an awkward, anachronistic leopard-print dress with a sheer cut-out around her knees that reduced the whole outfit to a misguided Flintstones tribute.
