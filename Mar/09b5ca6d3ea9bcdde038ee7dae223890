With a mixture of cornrows and single braids wrapped around her voluminous Afro,Â Mbatha's hairÂ was the perfect complement to her jaw-dropping David Tlale dress. We loved the addition of a single cowry shell decoration, which draws attention to her beautiful face.

She carried the theme of herÂ Quiteria & George gown into her hair by weaving pastel flowers into her baby Afro to create the ultimate flower crown.

That said, it's a stunning hairstyle anyone with a luscious natural Afro could easily copy. The actress swept her hair into a loose updo with a deep side parting for a look that was both simple and elegant.
