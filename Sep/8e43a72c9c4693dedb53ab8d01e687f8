From Nomzamo Mbatha to Pearl Thusi, some of our favourite celebrities rock their crowns in amazing styles, showing the world natural hair can be as beautiful as any other type of textured hair. However, it’s not always easy taking care of it, especially if you are transitioning back to a natural look after having your locks chemically-straightened, or you just did a big chop. So, if you're looking for guidance, try some of these handy hair care tips that A-listers have shared over the years: In an interview with W24, Mbatha said it was important to wash your hair once a week, even when wearing protective styles. “It is a myth that washing your hair less often leads to more growth. Regular washing stimulates the scalp, while going long intervals without washing causes build-up, which clogs pores and prevents growth. So wash weekly,” she said.

However, sometimes you might find yourself without access to your regular products when your hair is feeling dry. In an Instagram video, Nyong'o once showed her stylist using an iron’s spritz function to quickly moisturise her hair. @lupitanyongo  glowing as usual in the #cannes sunlight promoting a new movie #355movie  A spy thriller perhaps? #lupitanyongo A post shared by  Rozzy Ann (@ann.rozzy) on May 10, 2018 at 11:24am PDT My #tbt is a Hair tip from the infinitely talented @vernonfrancois: when you go #glamping and you forgot your spray bottle, an iron can come in very handy... #multipurposehouseholdappliances #Kenya #Amboseli #Safariglam #thisiscalledcreativity #dontturniton A post shared by  Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Jul 9, 2015 at 10:06am PDT Rae told InStyle Magazine she wasn’t afraid of trying a wide range to find products and styles that worked for her. “Thanks to people like [hairstylist] Felicia Leatherwood, who taught me different things that I can do with my hair, I’ve experimented with different products that bring it out the best, give it volume and help to easily style it.
